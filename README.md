# Generate Product Reviews
This project was an attempt to use an LSTM model to generate coherent text in the form of a product review on Amazon. The results left much to be desired, contained in this repo are:


## Archive (folder)
This was an initial pass at the project. Nothing in here is required for reviewing this project. This is just kept as reference for myself.

## Results (folder)
This is where results of the training are output. You can review the output in here and see how miserable my model performed. :)

## Notebooks
generate-product-reviews: This is where I put together a model and attempt to train it

product-review-eda: This, as the name states, is where I do some exploratory analysis.
